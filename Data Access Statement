Per the LINHAC competition requirements, we are unable to share the dataset outside of our group, including
within a GitHub repository. Therefore, the provided CSV file is not included alongside the code itself.

As a reminder, the Linkoping Hockey Analytics conference in Sweden holds a yearly competition where teams 
of students are provided with a dataset of a handful of games from the 2020-2021 season of the Swedish Hockey 
League. This dataset was leveraged for the work shared within this repository.
